## 🧠 How It Works

Palert combines a powerful **Rust** backend with a beautiful **Flutter** frontend. It uses a headless browser to intelligently scrape product information directly from websites, ensuring you get real-time data without relying on any third-party APIs. It even handles captchas by mimicking real user behavior.

### 🛠 Requirements

*   🖥️ A supported web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
*   🛠️ The matching **WebDriver** for your browser (e.g., [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) or [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  📥 **Download** the latest release from the Releases page.
2.  📂 **Place your WebDriver** executable in the required application folder.
3.  ▶️ **Run the app** and add your first product URL from Amazon or Flipkart.
4.  ⏲️ **Set your refresh interval** and let Palert do the rest!

> Palert will now monitor your products in the background. You'll get a notification if anything changes!

## 📅 Upcoming Features

*   🌍 **More Platforms**: Support for eBay, Meesho, Ubuy, and other international sites.
*   📧 **Alerts**: Email & SMS notifications for price drops and stock alerts.

## 🤖 Why I Made This

I built Palert to solve a personal problem: I was tired of manually checking multiple websites for price drops and stock updates. Existing tools were either too complex or didn't have the features I needed. So, I created my own solution that is simple, powerful, and respects user privacy by keeping all data local.
